        Now perform the aggregations. This is how it works:

        has rows with the same decision_id.
        
        2) "agg" uses the aggregations dict to create a new row for each 
        subset. The columns will be new and named after each key in the 
        aggregations dict. The cell values of each column will be based on 
        the NamedAgg named tuple, specified in the aggregations dict.
        
        3) These NamedAgg named tuples specify which column of the subset 
        will be passed to the specified aggregation functions.
        
        4) The aggregation functions process the values of the passed column 
        and return a single value, which will be the contents of the cell 
        in a new column for that subset.

        High Level Algorithm:
        
        1)  For each decision_id that is being ingested, we need to check if that decision_id is already covered by an existing partition

        2)  Each partition file S3 key starts with a prefix of the max KSUID in that partition and contains more characters after that.
        
        3)  S3's list_objects_v2 request returns results in lexicographical order, using the StartAfter option using a prefix key generated
            from the target decision_id, the first result will be the target partition.  If there are no results
            then the max decision_id in all partitions is less than the current one, so there will be no existing partition returned

            the range of decision_id prefixes that weâ€™re interested in.  We then use those listing results to partition the decisions by the
